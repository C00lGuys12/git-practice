I have learned this week that GITs and GitHub are very useful tools in development. 
GITs are save points on your PC of your progress.
GitHub allows you to put your saves online for others to collaborate.
Both of those are essential tools if you want to make programs for others to enjoy, no matter if you are by yourself or with others.
