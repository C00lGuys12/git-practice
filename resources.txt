I will nominate for the first award, the GITs. 
The GITs are restore points to prexisting points in time so you can add new features without worrying about a game breaking glitch.

The 2nd award I will nominate is GitHub. 
GitHub puts those GITs into the cloud so you can collaborate on projects.

The final award I will nominate are people who name their GITs with real changes.
Those people do not have to deal with the chaos that is trying to figure out what you changed in that file without that GIT telling you!

Awards show, out!
